				  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        </div>
				<p> The term hybrid intelligence refers to approaches and technology that enable cooperation between humans and intelligent machines. Temple University’s Center for Hybrid Intelligence (<abbr title="Center for Hybrid Intelligence">CHI</abbr>) is committed to
				promoting research, education, and software development activities towards
				building computer systems that could learn from experience, adapt, exhibit intelligent
				behavior, cooperate with humans, and improve human condition. </p>
				<p>We aim to become a center of excellence in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing and a catalyst
				for interdisciplinary research at Temple. We are providing cutting edge educational and
				research experiences for Temple students and training programs for continued education.
				We are promoting entrepreneurship and are fostering collaboration with industry, government, and nonprofit
				organizations in Greater Philadelphia and beyond. </p>

          <p>We are welcoming our new CHI member <a href="http://stevemacn.github.io/"> Dr. Stephen MacNeil </a>, who is starting his tenure track Assistant Professor appointment in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences in Fall 2021. Stephen is joining us from the UCSD Design Lab, where he was a postdoctoral researcher. In his research, Stephen is building on theories from learning sciences, social computing, and human-computer interaction to democratize design and education by integrating the perspectives of non-experts. </p>
